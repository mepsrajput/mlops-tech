                <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">Mathematics</p>
                <p>To be effective in MLOps (Machine Learning Operations), it is helpful to have a strong foundation in
                    mathematics,
                    specifically in linear algebra and calculus.</p>
                <p><strong>Linear algebra</strong> is a branch of mathematics that deals with vector spaces and linear
                    transformations. It
                    is a fundamental mathematical tool used in machine learning, particularly in the development of
                    algorithms for training
                    and using neural networks.</p>
                <p><strong>Calculus</strong> is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of change and motion.
                    It is used to analyze and optimize the performance
                    of machine learning models, particularly in the development of algorithms for training and using
                    neural networks.</p>
                <p>Other areas of mathematics that may be useful for MLOps include <strong>probability theory</strong>,
                    <strong>statistics</strong>,
                    and <strong>optimization</strong>.
                <p>In addition to learning these mathematical concepts, it is also important to have strong
                    problem-solving and analytical skills
                    and be able to apply mathematical concepts to real-world situations.</p>

                <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">SQL</p>
                <p><strong>SQL commands</strong>: These include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and CREATE TABLE.</p>
                <p><strong>Data manipulation</strong>: You should learn how to manipulate data in a database using
                    commands such as JOIN, UNION, and GROUP BY.</p>
                <p><strong>Stored procedures</strong>: Stored procedures are pre-written SQL scripts that can be used to
                    automate tasks or perform complex operations.
                    You should learn how to create and use stored procedures.</p>

                <h5 class="fw-bold">ML</h5>
                <p class="text-muted mb-2 fw-bold">Supervised Learning</p>
                <p><strong>Basic concepts</strong>: In supervised learning, you have a dataset with labeled examples
                    (inputs and outputs). Your goal is to build a model that
                    can predict the output given new inputs. You should understand the difference between classification
                    and regression tasks and how to evaluate
                    the performance of your model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.</p>
                <p><strong>Algorithms</strong>: There are many algorithms that can be used for supervised learning,
                    including linear regression, logistic regression, support
                    vector machines, and decision trees. You should learn about the strengths and weaknesses of these
                    algorithms and when to use them.</p>
                <p><strong>Feature engineering</strong>: The quality of your features (inputs) plays a significant role
                    in the performance of your model. You should learn how
                    to select and transform features to improve the predictive power of your model.
                <p><strong>Model selection</strong>: Choosing the right model for your problem is crucial to the success
                    of your project. You should learn how to evaluate and
                    compare different models using techniques such as cross-validation and performance metrics.
                <p><strong>Hyperparameter tuning</strong>: Many machine learning algorithms have hyperparameters that
                    need to be tuned to achieve optimal performance.
                    You should learn how to use techniques such as grid search and random search to tune hyperparameters
                    and improve the performance of your model.
                <p><strong>Overfitting and regularization</strong>: Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and
                    starts to memorize the training data rather
                    than generalizing to new inputs. You should learn how to use techniques such as regularization and
                    cross-validation to prevent overfitting and
                    improve the generalization of your model.</p>
                <p class="text-muted mb-2 fw-bold">Unsupervised Learning</p>
                <p>In unsupervised learning, the goal is to discover patterns or relationships in a dataset without the
                    guidance of labeled responses or
                    outcomes. Unsupervised learning algorithms are used to find patterns and structure in data, and can
                    be used for a variety of tasks
                    such as clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction.</p>
                <p>Some common techniques used in unsupervised learning include:</p>
                <p><strong>Clustering</strong>: Grouping data points into distinct clusters based on their similarity or
                    distance to one another.</p>
                <p><strong>Anomaly detection</strong>: Identifying data points that are unusual or different from the
                    rest of the data.</p>
                <p><strong>Dimensionality reduction</strong>: Reducing the number of features or dimensions in a dataset
                    while maintaining as much information as
                    possible.</p>
                <p><strong>Association rule learning</strong>: Identifying relationships between variables in a dataset,
                    such as identifying items that are
                    frequently purchased together in a store.</p>

                <p class="text-muted mb-2 fw-bold">DVC</p>
                <p>DVC (Data Version Control) is an open-source version control system for machine learning projects. It
                    is designed to help you manage and track data, code, and models as you develop and deploy machine
                    learning applications.

                    Some key features of DVC include:

                    Data version control: DVC allows you to track and version data files, including large datasets, as
                    you develop and test machine learning models.

                    Model version control: DVC provides support for versioning and tracking machine learning models,
                    including model files and parameters.

                    Dependency management: DVC helps you manage the dependencies of your machine learning projects,
                    including data and model files, code, and libraries.

                    Reproducibility: DVC makes it easier to reproduce machine learning experiments by tracking and
                    reproducing the exact data and model versions used in each experiment.

                <p class="text-muted mb-2 fw-bold">optuna</p>
                <p>Optuna is an open-source hyperparameter optimization library for machine learning. It allows you to
                    automate the process of searching for the best hyperparameter values for a machine learning model,
                    by running multiple trials and comparing the results.

                    Some key features of Optuna include:

                    Hyperparameter search: Optuna provides algorithms and APIs for searching for the optimal
                    hyperparameter values for a machine learning model.

                    Parallelization: Optuna supports parallelization of hyperparameter optimization trials, allowing you
                    to speed up the optimization process.

                    Visualization: Optuna includes a web UI for visualizing and comparing the results of hyperparameter
                    optimization trials.

                    Compatibility: Optuna is compatible with a variety of machine learning frameworks and libraries,
                    including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
